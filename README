--------
Overview
--------
The three tasks from project 3 are separated into 3 source files:

task1.cpp - Tests the RSA constructors.  Bad decrypts print
accordingly.
challenge_response.cpp - Performs a simple challenge response using
RSA.
blingsig.cpp - Creates 2 classes Alice, and Bob. 
  Alice and Bob then trade public private information to blindly sign a random
  number.

----------------
Running the Code
----------------
Included is a makefile which will build and run the software. Simply
type make on the command prompt.

Example Run:
$ make

(30059, 30047): Correct decrypt
(30071, 30059): Correct decrypt
========= Composite Pair Constructor ===========
(30090, 30072): Bad decrypt, composite numbers cannot be used for RSA since composite numbers violate phi = (p - 1)(q - 1) the mod inverse doesn't work properly.
(30092, 30090): Bad decrypt, composite numbers cannot be used for RSA since composite numbers violate phi = (p - 1)(q - 1) the mod inverse doesn't work properly.
(30098, 30092): Bad decrypt, composite numbers cannot be used for RSA since composite numbers violate phi = (p - 1)(q - 1) the mod inverse doesn't work properly.
(30104, 30098): Bad decrypt, composite numbers cannot be used for RSA since composite numbers violate phi = (p - 1)(q - 1) the mod inverse doesn't work properly.
(30110, 30104): Bad decrypt, composite numbers cannot be used for RSA since composite numbers violate phi = (p - 1)(q - 1) the mod inverse doesn't work properly.
(30114, 30110): Bad decrypt, composite numbers cannot be used for RSA since composite numbers violate phi = (p - 1)(q - 1) the mod inverse doesn't work properly.
(30120, 30114): Bad decrypt, composite numbers cannot be used for RSA since composite numbers violate phi = (p - 1)(q - 1) the mod inverse doesn't work properly.
(30134, 30120): Bad decrypt, composite numbers cannot be used for RSA since composite numbers violate phi = (p - 1)(q - 1) the mod inverse doesn't work properly.
(30138, 30134): Bad decrypt, composite numbers cannot be used for RSA since composite numbers violate phi = (p - 1)(q - 1) the mod inverse doesn't work properly.
(30140, 30138): Bad decrypt, composite numbers cannot be used for RSA since composite numbers violate phi = (p - 1)(q - 1) the mod inverse doesn't work properly.
